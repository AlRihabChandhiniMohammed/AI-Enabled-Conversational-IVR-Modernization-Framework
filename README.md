# Conversational IVR Modernization Framework

## Project Overview
This repository contains the work done as part of the Conversational IVR Modernization internship project. The aim of this project is to analyze a legacy IVR system and define the requirements needed to transform it into a more modern and scalable solution aligned with ACS and BAP platforms.

Traditional IVR systems rely on fixed, menu-driven interactions. This project focuses on identifying the limitations of such systems and proposing improvements that support better integration, flexibility, and performance.
